I am TingtingChang, a Chinese girl who is trying to become an awesome full stack developer and to make contributions to the female CS world. Right now I am at the tail of my graduate school year. I have been the U.S. for one year half but I am still working on my oral and writing English. So please feel free to correct me when I make mistakes and help me to make progress! Recently, I find workout is facinating and I like swimming, dancing, yoga and running even though my knees seems does not cooperate very well. Last but not the least, I like food. If you share the same hobbies with me, what are you waiting for? Let's be friends! :)

{% highlight javascript %}
function meow() {
    return 'meow';
}

function bark() {
    return 'woof';
}

function getRandomAnimal() {

    var animals = [
        'cat',
        'dog',
        'hippo',
        'lion',
        'bear',
        'zebra'
    ];

    return animals[Math.floor(Math.random()*animals.length)];
}

console.log(meow());
console.log(bark());
console.log(getRandomAnimal());
{% endhighlight %}

When I have free time, I would like to do something I like to relax. For example, I will do yoga, learn how to dance Zumba, go swimming, run for half hour (I am not a big fan of it but I am trying), watch some American dramas, read novels, go shopping with my friends and go to sleep earlier. By the way, my favorite book is Harry Potter and Harmonie is my hero. Moreover, I really like delicious food so I would try to cook or try them in the restaurants. I also like traditional Chinese art-craft skills so I would like to try some of them.If I have enough money, I would go to travel around the world. Actually, one of my dreams is to work in the different cities.

I have lived a simple life in DC now. I have to go to school to take classes and do some homework in the library. Except that, I will spend time to learn how to program. Recently, I am interested in R so I will spend some time to play with it. Also, I will make some time go to gym every day to keep me healthy and stay away from the hospital.

I think for the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had is my daily life in the US, which is the result of many people. Thanks to my family I have chance to make my dream come true. I know I still have a lot to learn before I achieve my goals but I am grateful and happy every day.

If I could go somewhere immediately, I would definitely choose London. It is hard to say exactly reasons but I will give it a try. Firstly, I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. Secondly, London is always a charming city and I like its cultural environment. Finally, I think there will be so many pretty girls. By the way, I am not a gay but I do like to appreciate pretty things which keeps me young and happy.

I will record my daily programming. If you like my projects or you have comments for my coding, feel free to contact me via &ensp;[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tingtingchang)&ensp;[GitHub](https://github.com/Tingting-Chang)&ensp;[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Chang_Tingting)
